# [Last index of One](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/last-index-of-15847/1/?category[]=Searching&category[]=Searching&problemStatus=unsolved&difficulty[]=-1&page=1&query=category[]SearchingproblemStatusunsolveddifficulty[]-1page1category[]Searching#)

## Basic

Given a string S consisting only '0's and '1's,  find the last index of the '1' present in it.

 

Example 1:
```
Input:
S = 00001
Output:
4
Explanation:
Last index of  1 in given string is 4.
 ```

Example 2:
```
Input:
0
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Since, 1 is not present, so output is -1.
 ```


Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function lastIndex() which takes the string S as inputs and returns the last index of '1'. If '1' is not present, return "-1" (without quotes).

 
```
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
```
 

Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 106
S = {0,1}
